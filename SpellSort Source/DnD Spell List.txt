Until the spell ends, the sphere@CRLFmoves with you, centered on you.@CRLFSpells and other magical effects, except those created@CRLFby an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere@CRLFand cant protrude into it. A slot expended to cast@CRLFa suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is@CRLFsuppressed, it doesnt function, but the time it spends@CRLFsuppressed counts against its duration.@CRLFTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,@CRLFsuch as magic missile and charm person, that target@CRLFa creature or an object in the sphere have no effect@CRLFon that target.@CRLFAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical@CRLFeffect, such as fireball, cant extend into the sphere.@CRLFIf the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of@CRLFthe area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.@CRLFFor example, the flames created by a wall of fire are@CRLFsuppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall@CRLFif the overlap is large enough.@CRLFSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a@CRLFcreature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while@CRLFthe creature or object is in it.@CRLFMagic Items.

For@CRLFexample, a + 1 longsword in the sphere functions as a@CRLFnonmagical longsword.@CRLFA magic weapons properties and powers are@CRLFsuppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or@CRLFwielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic w eapon@CRLFor a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere@CRLF(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic@CRLFspear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the@CRLFitem ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.@CRLFMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel@CRLFfail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the@CRLFdestination or the departure point for such magical@CRLFtravel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of@CRLFexistence, as w ell as an opening to an extradimensional@CRLFspace such as that created by the rope trick spell,@CRLFtemporarily closes while in the sphere.@CRLFCreatures and Objects.

Such a creature instantly@CRLFreappears once the space the creature occupied is no@CRLFlonger within the sphere.@CRLFDispel Magic.

The enchantment causes creatures of the@CRLFkind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the@CRLFarea and avoid the target. When such a creature can@CRLFsee the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature@CRLFmust succeed on a W isdom saving throw or b ecome@CRLFfrightened. The creature remains frightened while it can@CRLFsee the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened@CRLFby the target, the creature must use its movement to@CRLFmove to the nearest safe spot from which it cant see@CRLFthe target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from@CRLFthe target and cant see it, the creature is no longer@CRLFfrightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if@CRLFit regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.@CRLFSympathy. The enchantment causes the specified@CRLFcreatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target@CRLFwhile within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a@CRLFcreature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it,@CRLFthe creature must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or@CRLFuse its movement on each of its turns to enter the area@CRLFor move within reach of the target.

If the portal would@CRLFopen in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,@CRLFand the casting is lost.@CRLFThe portals are two-dimensional glowing rings@CRLFfilled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and@CRLFperpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is@CRLFvisible only from one side (your choice), which is the side@CRLFthat functions as a portal.@CRLFAny creature or object entering the portal exits from@CRLFthe other portal as if the two were adjacent to each@CRLFother; passing through a portal from the nonportal side@CRLFhas no effect.

The principal difference is the addition of @CRLFa silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder@CRLFblades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after@CRLF1 foot.

If you enter a new plane or return to the@CRLFplane you were on when casting this spell, your body and@CRLFpossessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing@CRLFyou to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.@CRLFYour astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage@CRLFor other effects that apply to it have no effect on your@CRLFphysical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.@CRLFThe spell ends for you and your companions when@CRLFyou use your action to dismiss it.

That entity@CRLFsends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to@CRLFaid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied@CRLFspace within range. If you know a specific creatures@CRLFname, you can speak that name when you cast this spell@CRLFto request that creature, though you might get a different@CRLFcreature anyway (DMs choice).@CRLFWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion@CRLFto behave in any particular way.

You must be@CRLFable to communicate with the creature to bargain for@CRLFits services.@CRLFPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might@CRLFrequire a sizable donation of gold or m agic items to@CRLFan allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living@CRLFsacrifice or a gift of treasure.

The DM can adjust these payments based on@CRLFthe circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the@CRLFtask is aligned with the creatures ethos, the payment@CRLFmight be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks@CRLFtypically require only half the suggested payment, while@CRLFespecially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift.@CRLFCreatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.@CRLFAfter the creature completes the task, or when the@CRLFagreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature@CRLFreturns to its home plane after reporting back to you,@CRLFif appropriate to the task and if possible.

If@CRLFthe creature w as summoned or created by another spell,@CRLFthat spells duration is extended to match the duration@CRLF@CRLFof this spell.@CRLFA bound creature must follow your instructions to the@CRLFbest of its ability. You might command the creature to@CRLFaccompany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or@CRLFto deliver a message. The creature obeys the letter of@CRLFyour instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it@CRLFstrives to twist your w ords to achieve its own objectives.@CRLFIf the creature carries out your instructions completely@CRLFbefore the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact@CRLFif you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a@CRLFdifferent plane of existence, it returns to the place where@CRLFyou bound it and remains there until the spell ends.@CRLFAt Higher Levels.

The object can be no more than@CRLF300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied@CRLFspace you can see on the ground.@CRLF• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to@CRLFregain all hit points, and you end all effects on them@CRLFdescribed in the greater restoration spell.@CRLF• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance@CRLFto a damage type you choose.@CRLF• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to@CRLFa single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For@CRLFinstance, you could make yourself and all your companions@CRLFimmune to a lichs life drain attack.@CRLF• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of@CRLFany roll made within the last round (including your@CRLFlast turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the@CRLFnew result. For example, a wish spell could undo an@CRLFopponents successful save, a foes critical hit, or a@CRLFfriends failed save. You can force the reroll to be made@CRLFwith advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose@CRLFwhether to use the reroll or the original roll.@CRLFYou might be able to achieve something beyond the@CRLFscope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM@CRLFas precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in@CRLFruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the@CRLFwish, the greater the likelihood that something goes@CRLFwrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire@CRLFmight only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some@CRLFunforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded@CRLFthe wish. For example, wishing that a villain w ere dead@CRLFmight propel you forward in time to a period when that@CRLFvillain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from@CRLFthe game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item@CRLFor artifact might instantly transport you to the presence@CRLF@CRLFof the items current owner.@CRLFThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect@CRLFother than duplicating another spell w eakens you. After@CRLFenduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until@CRLFyou finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage@CRLFper level of that spell. This damage cant be reduced or@CRLFprevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops@CRLFto 3, if it isnt 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each@CRLF@CRLFof those days that you spend resting and doing nothing@CRLFmore than light activity, your remaining recovery time@CRLFdecreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent@CRLFchance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you@CRLFsuffer this stress. @CRLF@CRLF
