This handy tool allows you to view the Rules for the various Magic Items found in D&D (5e) -- [Example Pic](http://imgur.com/uVQnh3J)

  - Double Click view Rules \ Descriptions
  - All Rules are saveable\Modifyable (so that you can take out the rules and parts you dont need) + Refresh button if you dun f**k up
  - Sort by columns (this can be dumb due to txt based sorting)
  - All columns are searchable via text and some by dropdown
  - Select multiple items at once and Press Enter to open them all.
  - Or press enter to search when search fields have focus
  - Smart Width (Should bring the width of the window out for Tables\Headings)

# SpellSort

Spell Sort is a desktop app to sort through the various spells available in Dungeons and Dragons.

[Example.gif](http://imgur.com/P4PZAqb) 

- Double or Right Click for Spell Rules, Components & Descriptions
- Everything is searchable by text or drop down.

## Item Sort
Pretty much the same as Spell sort but rewritten to work with the following: 

- Weapons
- Adventuring Gear
- Armour
- Mounts
- Tools
- [Example .Gif](http://imgur.com/csYB3Rs)

Everything is searchable by text or drop down (which is handy as the Cost & weight columns do not sort correctly due to being plain text.)
