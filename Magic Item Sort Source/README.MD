# Magic Item Sort
---
This handy tool allows you to view the Rules for the various Magic Items found in D&D (5e)

  - Double Click view Rules \ Descriptions
  - All Rules are saveable\Modifyable (so that you can take out the rules and parts you dont need) + Refresh button if you dun f**k up
  - Sort by columns (this can be dumb due to txt based sorting)
  - All columns are searchable via text and some by dropdown
  - Select multiple items at once and Press Enter to open them all.
  - Or press enter to search when search fields have focus
  - Smart Width (Should bring the width of the window out for Tables\Headings)

## Misc Item Generator
This Generator was requested by a friend of mine to allow DMs to give party members access to standard items as part of looting creatures or areas. You can choose between the following:

- Adventuring Gear
- Armour
- Mounts
- Tools
- Weapons

You can also set a Max Price (per/Item) so that the loot is not overpowered for wherever your party currently is at. This also requires some common sense from the DM. If you set a (very) high limit on the Items you might just end up with a boat, which is not going to do anyone any good in the middle of the desert. 

## Magic Item History
Luckblade seemingly a bit bland? Why not give it a a few Quirks?
The Magic Item History is a Generator from the D&D DM handbook that allows you to roll on the following Tables:

- Creator
- History
- Minor Property(s) - Possible to get 2 if you roll a 20 on the first roll
- Quirks

### Dice Roller
Do your Wrists ache? Too many dice Weighing you down in life? Not too worry Doddler's Dice Roller is here..

Yeah as the title suggest just a basic dice roller - pick the dice and the amount and fire away.

### Use
There is an option to flick between Small and Full Form Factors in the GUI. Obviously the Full Form Factor gives you more options easily, while the Small utilises Menus. I thought this might be handy though since you probably aren't going to be using a 27" 4k monitor to DM.

Within the Individual Treasure windows there is a Lock option to Lock and Unlock the Treasure for Editing (useful for Splitting up Loot). A Reset button (incase you dun f**ked up.) And a Save button if your gameplay session is interrupted.

Other than that, everything else should be pretty self explanatory. If you want to see the individual dice rolls there is an Option to do so in the Options Menu. Tickboxes to tickbox things (on/Off - True/False). And Titles are optional (Windows will be given a generic Title).

##### Suggestions
I'm always open to suggestions on how to make tools such as this better. Drop me a message on reddit (/u/sdoddler) and I'll have a chat :)

This was originally created after someone suggested a way to sort Magic Items. Upon looking at the DM Handbook Magic Items are a pain to sort because they are basically just massive bits of text and no real information. So I started playing around with a way to generate treasure instead :P I may  eventually get to a way to sort Magic Items if more people would like to see it? ( I HAVE DONE THIS NOW!! PROGRESS DOT JPG)
